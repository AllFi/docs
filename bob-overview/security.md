# Security

### Beta Release

Bob and zkBob will be released in a beta version. The contracts have not yet been audited and users should use at their own discretion. During beta we are mitigating risks to users by [limiting deposits and withdrawals](deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md). In addition, the overall size of a pool cannot exceed 1,000,000 BOB tokens.

### Bug Bounty

Bounties are one of the most important tools for testing and enhancing application and contract security. We are in the planning phases to implement a bug bounty through Immunefi to help protect users and their funds.
