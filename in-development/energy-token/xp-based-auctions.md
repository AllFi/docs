# XP-based Auctions

{% hint style="info" %}
Feature in development and will not be active for first iteration of the zkBob application.
{% endhint %}

zkBob will earn some revenue for the protocol through funds compounding, fees or other TBD mechanisms. In order to distribute these funds, weekly auctions will be held to distribute them to the highest XP bidder. More details coming soon.
