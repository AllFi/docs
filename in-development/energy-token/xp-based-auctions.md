description: Novel auction mechanism to distribute protocol revenue

# XP-based Auctions

{% hint style="info" %}
Feature in development and will not be active for the first iteration of the zkBob application.
{% endhint %}

zkBob will earn some revenue for the protocol through funds compounding and fees. In order to distribute these funds, weekly auctions will be held to distribute them to the highest XP bidder.&#x20;

Auctions may also include "lost" Bob tokens. These are tokens which are accidentally sent to the wrong contract with no retrieval mechanisms, tokens left idle for long periods of time in wallets with no funds for gas, or tokens which are not active in the protocol and have not been used in any manner for some tbd time increment.&#x20;

These mechanics are still in development, and more details will be available in the future.
