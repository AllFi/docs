## Update: Account compliance verification

This new feature reduces the risk of zkBob usage by malicious actors. An integration with TRM labs allows the application to detect suspicious wallets and prevent deposits from those wallets into zkBob. Withdrawals from zkBob also cannot be sent to wallets identified as suspicious. This is an important feature to reduce illicit funds from entering the zkPool and tainting existing Bob within the pool.&#x20;
