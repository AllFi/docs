# Operator Manager Contract

{% hint style="info" %}
The **operator** - is a native chain address which interacts with the Pool contract. In general the relayer or standalone user can become operator. In most cases the operator is just a relayer.
{% endhint %}

The operator manager contract delimits access to the Pool. Transactions should be included in the Merkle tree strictly in a serial manner. The relayer node (or a user in case of direct Pool interaction) should calculate Merkle tree proof (zkSNARK) before transaction sending. But the transaction will revert if the Merkle tree has changed during this calculation. If several relayers send transactions simultaneously the collisions will appear and fee will become wasted.

To prevent this case we restrict the Pool interaction with the Operator Manager contract. The Operator manager contract has two mandatory methods:

```solidity
function is_operator() external view returns(bool);
```

`This` routine returns true when the transaction origin sender can interact with the Pool currently.

```solidity
function operator() external view returns(address);
```

This function returns a current operator address (native chain). The are two extra case for `operator` function:

* There are several operators allowed to interact with Pool at this time (e.g. primary and reserve operators). In this case the `operator` function should returns any of these addresses.
* The are no limits for Pool interaction (anybody can send transaction to the Pool). The `operator` function should returns `address(0)`
