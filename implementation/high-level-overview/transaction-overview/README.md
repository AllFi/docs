# Transaction Overview

The main purpose of any transaction is to move funds on the blockchain. Each transaction has several inputs and outputs. [Account](../account-and-notes/accounts.md) and [notes](../account-and-notes/notes.md) can be used as inputs and outputs.

The current implementation assumes that each transaction has a single input and output account and a fixed number of input (3) and output (127) notes.

The input and output accounts designate a transaction initiator. Account changes (including balance, energy and spent offset) are reflected in the output account.

{% hint style="info" %}
The input account should be omitted for the first transaction from this account.
{% endhint %}

The input notes are spending funds. Only the note owner can use as a transaction input.  The account spent offset should be changed after a note is used. The output notes are addressed to the funds receiver.
