description: Bob will deploy on Polygon for several reasons.

# Bob on Polygon

Bob has been in research and development since December 2020. The original concept was initiated by members of the now defunct xDai research group and the [ZeroPool](https://zeropool.network/) team. Initially, Bob was slated for deployment to the xDai chain, however Polygon's robust infrastructure and commitment to zk-based solutions led contributors to select Polygon for deployment.

## Bob Timeline

* December 2020: R\&D initiated.
* June 2021: Prototyping and ongoing contract development on xDai.
* December 2021: New contributors improve contracts, implement applications, prepare Kovan deployment.
* March 2022: Testing, bug fixing, protocol updates and enhancements.
* August 2022:  Prep for beta launch and trusted ceremony, select Polygon for deployment.

## Why Polygon?

Polygon infrastructure is mature and robust, completely supporting the needs of the Bob protocol. This application environment (along with the scalability Polygon affords) does not exist in the same way on any other chain.  Prerequisites for Bob include:

* Uniswap v3
* Aave
* Native USDC implementation

In addition, Polygon has shown their belief in advancing zk-based solutions with Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Nightfall, Polygon Miden, Polygon Zero and others. They are leaders in zero knowledge development and research.&#x20;

Finally, Bob values are aligned with those of the Polygon founders, and we appreciate their continued commitment to protecting privacy and neutrality for the Ethereum ecosystem.
