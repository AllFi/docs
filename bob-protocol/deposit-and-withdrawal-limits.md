# Deposit & Withdrawal Limits

Limits are imposed to protect against large deposits which may result from illegal activity (for example a hack where attackers need to quickly move a large amount of funds). Individual deposits, accounts, and the protocol itself adhere to the following deposit limits.&#x20;

**Deposits**

1. A single deposit cannot exceed 10,000 BOB.
2. A single address cannot deposit more than 10,000 BOB during a single 24 hour period.
3. All deposits from all addresses cannot exceed 100,000 BOB during a single 24 hour period.
4. The overall size of a pool cannot exceed 1,000,000 BOB.

**Withdrawals**

1. All withdrawals from all addresses cannot exceed 100,000 BOB during a single 24 hour period.

The above limits are set for initial protocol launch, and are upgradeable. They will be evaluated as the protocol grows. Note the 10,000 deposit limit is an established reporting standard relevant to travel, banking, and other industries.
