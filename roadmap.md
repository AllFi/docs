# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
In process. Time estimates and other functionality will be added as implementation details are clarified.
{% endhint %}

## V1

* MVP application for private deposits, transfers and withdrawals on a single chain of record (Gnosis Chain).

## V2

* OmniBridge application for private bridged transactions deposits from Ethereum to the Gnosis Chain and withdrawals from the GC to Ethereum.
* Multi-relayers to improve speed and storage capabilities.

## V3

* Optimism deployment to enable private and secure multi-chain functionality. A singe zkpool will reside on a chain of record with withdrawals/deposits flowing through this pool. Transactions can be initiated from the originating chain, flow to the zkpool on the chain of record, then withdrawn to a destination chain of choice.
