# GP 1: BobVault (BobSwap) beta testing infrastructure

GP #1 was the first governance proposal enacted by the 3/6 multisig submitted and approved to launch BobVault (also known as BobSwap) beta testing. The beta version of the BobVault was initiated along with a testing fee structure, and 1,000 BOB was added for testing purposes. Following the finalized security audit and contracts upgrade, BobSwap fee structure was updated and testing funds refunded in [GP #3](gp-3-enable-bobvault-bobswap-for-public-use.md).&#x20;
