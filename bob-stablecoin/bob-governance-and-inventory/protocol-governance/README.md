# Protocol Governance

During beta a multisig SAFE (currently composed of a 4/7 risk-assessment team) is used to manage protocol upgrades and risk assessment. This threshold was established with GP 0 and updated with GP 4. Protocol updates are handled through the SAFE. For more info on governance see the [BOB DAO](../bob-dao.md) page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* The Governance SAFE address is [0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8](https://app.safe.global/matic:0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8/home)
{% endhint %}

In addition to [inventory management](../inventory-management/), the beta governance team also proposes and completes protocol updates. Details regarding specific updates are linked below.

**GP** stands for **Governance Proposal**.
