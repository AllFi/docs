# GP 0: Increase SAFE membership

GP #0 added 2 additional DAO members to the governance safe, increasing the necessary signature threshold to execute a transaction to 3 members and establishing a 3/6 baseline multisig. This marks the beginning of a more formal (though still beta) governance process and going forward Governance Proposals will be numbered when proposed.
