# GP 8: Extend pool limits for KYC'd users

## Objective

Allow KYC'd users to deposit additional funds into zkBOB. An additional tier is added to increase limits to 20,000 BOB per day for users who hold a BAB NFT on Binance Chain.

### BAB NFTs

In 2022, Binance introduced soulbound tokens known as [Binance Account Bound (BAB) tokens](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/frequently-asked-questions-on-binance-account-bound-bab-token-adbd05fe149344d59a348f82d5bf359d). These tokens serve as identity credentials for Binance users who have completed KYC verification. These credentials can be extended to other chains using the [KnowYourCat](https://docs.knowyourcat.id/) protocol.

### KnowYourCat Protocol

Information about BAB token ownership can be transferred from BNB Smart Chain to additional chains using the [KnowYourCat](https://docs.knowyourcat.id/) protocol. This protocol creates a cryptographic proof that a user possesses the token on BSC and lets users provide this proof to other supported chains. A users BAB token status can be obtained from an NFT-compatible contract. The official KnowYourCat contract on Polygon is at [0xE3c6Fd631043A0a1927c4681C736b778aA8F8feF](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xE3c6Fd631043A0a1927c4681C736b778aA8F8feF), as referenced in the [KnowYourCat documentation](https://docs.knowyourcat.id/for-developers/knowyourcat-protocol/contract-addresses).

## Mechanism

To extend limits for BAB token holders, this proposal creates a new tier limit in the pool and configures a KYC Provider Manager which checks the status of BAB token ownership on the KnowYourCat NFT contract.

The KYC Provider Manager manager is deployed at [0xb8580ea6312dd2311d72bc932b0354a07d974138](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb8580ea6312dd2311d72bc932b0354a07d974138).&#x20;

This manager contract introduces the method `getIfKYCpassedAndTier` to access the limit tier for a user owning BAB token. The manager provides `254` as the tier id for users who hold a BAB NFT.

The manager is configured so that each time a user requests the deposit, the account is checked to see if it has its own tier limit. If it does not, the manager is asked to return the tier and default limits apply.

## Proposal breakdown

The corresponding transaction in the governance safe is[ transaction #28](https://app.safe.global/matic:0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8/transactions/tx?id=multisig\_0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8\_0x313f81393765ffe7f9353306248891380ad4c14f95a270ef05dbbe520c48acab).

The transaction contains 2 actions:

### Action 1

`setLimits` (the selector is 0xe8fd02e4) is called from the zkBobPool contract ([0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB)). The method is called to configure limits for tier `254` which is associated with users owning BAB tokens. The limits for this tier differs from tier `0` where `dailyUserDepositCap` and `depositCap` are both 10â€™000 BOB.

```
tvlCap: 1'000'000 BOB
dailyDepositCap: 300'000 BOB
dailyWithdrawalCap: 100'000 BOB
dailyUserDepositCap: 20'000 BOB
depositCap: 20'000 BOB
dailyUserDirectDepositCap: 10'000 BOB
directDepositCap: 1'000 BOB
```

The zkBobPool contract is upgraded to reflect these changes. ([0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB)). The new implementation [0x0eDcE5CAf830c6b845503001D8378b0d4F3b89bB](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0eDcE5CAf830c6b845503001D8378b0d4F3b89bB) is applied through the `upgradeTo` call (the selector is 0x3659cfe6).

### Action 2

`setKycProvidersManager` (the selector 790c3a33) is called from the zkBobPool contract ([0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x72e6B59D4a90ab232e55D4BB7ed2dD17494D62fB)). The method adds the contract [0xb8580ea6312dd2311d72bc932b0354a07d974138](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb8580ea6312dd2311d72bc932b0354a07d974138) as the KYC Provider Manager.

## Verification

After the proposal execution the zkBobPool contract can be checked:

1. The method `kycProvidersManager` must return `0xb8580ea6312dd2311d72bc932b0354a07d974138`
2. The method `getLimitsFor` for an account synchronised with BAB token ownership information through [the KnowYourCat protocol](https://knowyourcat.id/) should display new limits. For example, one could use the account `0x813399e5b08Bb50b038AA7dF6347b6AF2D161828`.
