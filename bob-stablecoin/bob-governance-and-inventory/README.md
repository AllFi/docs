# BOB Governance & Inventory

BOB inventory and protocol updates are handled via a governance [multi-sig SAFE.](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/matic:0xd4a3D9Ca00fa1fD8833D560F9217458E61c446d8/home) This process will be transitioned to a [larger BOB DAO](bob-dao.md) following the beta implementation.

### Protocol Governance

Updates to the protocol are managed via the governance SAFE. More info on protocol governance, decisions, and implementations [is available here.](protocol-governance/)

### Inventory Management

Inventory increases and decreases are managed by the SAFE in response to market conditions and demand. Inventory and collateralized supply are [tracked here](https://dune.com/maxaleks/bob-stable-token).
