# Mellow Protocol Vaults

Mellow Protocol provides trustless DeFi strategies and convenient, automated pools for high APR earnings. BOB strategies supported on Polygon currently include a WETH/BOB vault on Uniswap and a second WETH/BOB vault on QuickSwap.

Mellow's advantages include providing a narrow liquidity range so users collect max fees, and an automated process for rebalancing when prices near the current interval margin. In addition, strategies automatically swap rewards (when applicable, such as with dQuick rewards) into WETH and seamlessly add these back into the vault.

1\) Go to [https://app.mellow.finance/products](https://app.mellow.finance/products) and press **Connect wallet**.
