# BOB DAO

As the BOB stablecoin continues to gain traction on a multi-chain basis, a larger DAO will be formed for operation management purposes. Since the protocol is upgradeable, there is a need for an overarching and distributed governing body.

* **Beta Phase 1**: The current beta phase, a 3/6 multisig SAFE is tasked with protocol management. This SAFE is composed of members of the zkBob team and the Blockscout team. These teams have experience and an excellent track record with the xDai chain and TokenBridge managing 200M+ in assets. This small multisig provides the ability to iterate quickly and immediately fix any problems that arise during beta.&#x20;
* **Post Beta Phase 2**: A larger DAO will be established to manage critical operations such as upgradeability, BOB minting, CDP management and other significant protocol decisions. Membership criteria is still in discussion with a mission to find a dedicated and diverse group of projects and individuals across BOB ecosystems responsible for protocol management.
