# BOB DAO

As the BOB stablecoin continues to gain multi-chain traction, a larger DAO is in early-stage formation. This DAO will be tasked with operations management and overseeing processes that require thoughtful deliberation. Since the protocol is upgradeable, there is a need for an overarching and distributed governing body.

* **Beta Phase 1**: The current beta phase, a 3/6 multisig SAFE is tasked with protocol management. This SAFE is composed of members of the zkBob team and the [Blockscout](https://docs.blockscout.com/) team. These teams have experience and an excellent track record with the xDai chain (now [Gnosis Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com/)) and TokenBridge managing 200M+ in assets. This small multisig provides the ability to iterate quickly and immediately fix time-sensitive problems that arise during beta.&#x20;
* **Post Beta Phase 2**: A larger DAO will be established to manage significant operations such as upgradeability, BOB minting, CDP management and other important protocol decisions. Membership criteria is still in discussion with a mission to find a dedicated and diverse group of projects and individuals across BOB ecosystems responsible for protocol management.
