# BOB Details

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB is a multi-chain & multi-collateral stable token (stablecoin) enhanced with optional privacy features.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB can be acquired by swapping from other tokens using [Uniswap v3](get-bob-on-uniswap-v3.md) or [Metamask](swap-bob-with-metamask-swap.md) on Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon. BOB can also be transferred between users in a shielded form using the zkBOB application.

:heavy\_check\_mark:  BOB is optimized for zkBob. Once deposited, BOB can be sent privately between participants in the zkpool. Transfers are done completely within the application - there is no need to use or connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any other web3 wallet to conduct private transfers and you only need BOB, there is no additional fee token.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB inventory is currently available on Polygon, Optimism, and Ethereum. Additional chains may be added in the future to support multi-chain deposits and withdrawals.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB will be used to explore new mechanics for privacy, governance, and value capture for stablecoin users, such as redistribution of lost funds, compounding yield refunds, and other features.&#x20;

<summary>How do BOB tokens remain stable?</summary>

BOB tokens are pre-minted and paired with an existing stable token (multi-collateral, for example USDC and BUSD) on Uniswap V3. Uniswap v3 features the ability to set a range for the exchange rate and provide concentrated liquidity for the pair, resulting in very limited slippage to the stablecoin peg.
