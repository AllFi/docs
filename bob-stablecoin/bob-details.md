# BOB Highlights

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB is a multi-chain & multi-collateral stable token (stablecoin) enhanced with optional privacy features.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB is acquired through swaps using apps like [Paraswap](https://app.paraswap.io/#/BOB-USDC/100?network=polygon\&ref=0x02BF3258D6024B2B34fD7D21F225Db6CDA939E76), [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/137/unified/swap/USDC/BOB), [Uniswap v3,](bob-on-uniswap-v3.md) [Metamask,](add-bob-to-metamask/swap-bob-with-metamask-swap.md) [Kyberswap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/bnb/bob-to-busd), [OKX](https://www.okx.com/web3/dex?inputChain=137\&inputCurrency=0xb0b195aefa3650a6908f15cdac7d92f8a5791b0b\&outputCurrency=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\&outputChain=1), [DefiLlama meta-aggregator](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=polygon\&from=0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174\&to=0xb0b195aefa3650a6908f15cdac7d92f8a5791b0b) and others. BOB can also be transferred between users in a shielded form using the zkBOB application. Learn more about the [Bob Ecosystem](bob-ecosystem/).

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB inventory is currently available on Polygon, Optimism, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. Additional chains may be added in the future to support multi-chain deposits and withdrawals.

:heavy\_check\_mark:  BOB is optimized for zkBob. Once deposited, BOB can be sent privately between participants in the zkpool. Transfers are done completely within the application - there is no need to use or connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any other web3 wallet to conduct private transfers and you only need BOB, there is no additional fee token.

:heavy\_check\_mark: BOB will be used to explore new mechanics for privacy, governance, and self-sustaining value capture for the protocol, such as redistribution of lost funds, compounding yield, and other features.&#x20;
