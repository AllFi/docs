# Basic Concepts

### Zero-knowledge proofs

zkBob uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify that an action has been completed (deposit, transfer, withdrawal) without providing any other identifying details about that action. In this application, zkproofs show that the chain state has changed without divulging information about amounts, initiators of transactions or receivers of transactions.

### zkBob Account

A zkBob account is linked to a user by way of a private key. The private key is used to identify the account balance, to generate proofs to transfer tokens, and to withdraw tokens from the pool.&#x20;

zkBob accounts are created either from the private key of an existing wallet or from a stand-alone seed phrase. Users can choose how they would like to create an account though the UI following a step-by-step process.

Accounts never appear unencrypted in a public field and can only be decyrpted by the account owner.

### zkBob Address

A zkBob account doesn't contain a fixed address for receiving funds. Rather, the user generates a private zkBob address. Ideally, a new address is generated for each incoming transaction.&#x20;

It is not possible to link different private addresses to one another or to the primary account. Only the account owner can confirm ownership of a private address.

Each created address is encoded in base58 format. For example `5fkW3dXTvA8Kizt1EbuRyjWofuqR4Ud1YTjGgY1r8nGosDeSaUreq6bwfF61jWL`

### **Deposits**

Deposits can be made by sending a direct transaction (from a zkBob Account) into the zkBob contract on the Gnosis Chain, which adds the funds into the zkBob pool. This is accomplished through the UI.

### **Transfers**

Transfers use specialized zkBob relayers to send private transactions. A user can transfer funds to another zkBob account by sending zk-proofs anonymously to one of relayers. The relayer publishes the transaction to the zkBob contract on the Gnosis Chain.

### Withdrawals

Similar to deposits, a user can send a direct transaction to the zkBob contract in the Gnosis Chain to withdraw tokens from the pool. The transaction contains a zero-knowledge proof of tokens ownership generated using the private key associated with the corresponding zkBob account.

### **sxDai**

sxDai is shielded xDai, a secure token used for transfers within the zero-knowledge pool.  xDai is automatically converted to sxDai when completing a deposit, and sxDai is converted back to xDai on withdrawal.

### Relayer

The relayer acts as an intermediary between the user and the smart contracts. Transactions are sent to the relayer which processes input transactions, calculates Merkle tree proofs, then sends this information to the contract. The relayer preserves anonymity by abstracting gas fees for operations, and provides encrypted transaction storage. Clients interact with the relayer via a [REST API](technical-overview/relayer-node/rest-api.md).
