# Overview

zkBob is a privacy solution developed by [ZeroPool ](https://zeropool.network)and the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com) (GC) research teams. Version 1 will be deployed on the GC with a multi-chain roadmap for the future. This includes an Optimism deployment.

The application allows users to deposit arbitrary token amounts to a zero-knowledge pool, transfer these deposits to others using zkSnarks technology (proof of transaction without details of the sender, recipient, and value) within the pool, and withdraw arbitrary amounts securely and privately.

The initial implementation is a stand-alone application, with a bridge-enabled application currently in development.
