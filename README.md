# Overview

zkBob is an advanced blockchain privacy solution for safeguarding P2P financial transfers. With zkBob, users can easily:&#x20;

1. Deposit arbitrary token amounts into a zero-knowledge pool.
2. Transfer deposits within the pool to other participants using zkSnarks technology (proof of transaction without disclosing details of the sender, recipient, and value).
3. Withdraw arbitrary token amounts securely and privately.

zkBob is developed by [ZeroPool ](https://zeropool.network)and the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com) (GC) research teams. V1 will be deployed in a [Trusted Setup Ceremony](technical-overview/zkbob-solution-deployment/trusted-setup-ceremony.md) on the Gnosis Chain, with a multi-chain deployment on Optimism to follow.
