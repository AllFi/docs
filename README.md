# Bob and zkBob

**Bob is an easy-to-use protocol** designed to give regular crypto users new stablecoin-based utility. Users swap USDC for BOB tokens to get started. BOB can then be used in conjunction with the zkBob application to conduct small, discreet transactions between protocol users.

**zkBob is a zk-based application** which introduces a private transaction pool.  zkBob enables secure, limited-value, anonymous stablecoin transfers between users. [Deposit limits](bob-protocol/deposit-and-withdrawal-limits.md) and [compliance features](bob-protocol/compliance.md) provide a safe transactional environment for everyday users.

**zkBob is free for users**. Transaction fees within the application are subsidized at project launch, and future iterations will incorporate [compounding](roadmap/compounding.md), lost token recovery, and other mechanisms to create an evergreen platform.

**Bob and zkBob will be deployed on Polygon** to take advantage of existing infrastructure (Uniswap v3, Aave, and native USDC), scalability, and to support their commitment to zk-based solutions. [Learn More](bob-protocol/bob-on-polygon.md).

## **Bob and Alice** 🐇&#x20;

_A use case for the zkBob transactional app._

Alice is a well-known comic book collector. She does a lot of business on the blockchain, but prefers to keep the details of her purchases, sales, customers and clients private. Luckily, she finds Bob!

🐇 Alice uses 100 USDC to purchase 100 BOB stablecoins on Uniswap v3 on Polygon.&#x20;

🐇 She creates a zkBob account using the private key from an existing Ethereum Externally Owned Account (EOA). She could also create directly from a seed phrase, but chooses to create using MetaMask 🦊.

🐇 Once the account is connected, Alice deposits her 100 BOB into the zkBob pool.&#x20;

🐇 Alice wants to buy an original Marvel comic from Carl.  She messages him privately and he sends her a private address he has generated in the zkBob app. Alice transfers 50 BOB to Carl within the pool. He mails the comics.

🐇 She is also owed some funds from Dave for a Ghost Rider. She sends him a generated address and receives 120 BOB. These transfers are catalogued in the UI and linked to her zkBob address, but not directly to her EOA.

🐇 Alice is ready to withdraw, but waits a few days to allow the anonymity set to grow. After a few days she orders a withdrawal to a newly generated EOA.&#x20;

🐇 Alice now has a new account with 170 BOB. She converts them back to 170 USDC on Uniswap. There is no way to determine the origin of the funds, and Alice, Carl and Dave are able to preserve their anonymity and grow their comic collections safely and securely, thanks to zkBob!

## Development and Deployment

Bob protocol is an is an application originally developed by the xDai research group with assistance from [ZeroPool ](https://zeropool.network/)for the zkBob application. A production instance is planned for deployment in a decentralized manner via a [Trusted Setup Ceremony](deployment/trusted-setup-ceremony.md).&#x20;
