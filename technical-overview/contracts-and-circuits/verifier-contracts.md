# Verifier contracts

The verifier contracts are using to validate zkSNARK proofs. There are two verifiers in the zkBob solution:

* **Transaction verifier** is used for check transaction correctness. The associated proofs are generated by the user on transaction creating. It's calculated with the [transaction circuit](../zksnarks-and-circuits/transaction-verifier-circuit.md). The main question the verifier answers is whether the user could make such a deposit\transfer\withdrawal
* **Tree verifier** is used to check Merkle tree updating sequence. Transaction subtree (which should be added to the general tree) should be placed on the correct offset and update Merkle tree root properly. The associated proofs are usually generated by the relayer (but the user should calculate the proof himself when he want to interact with the Pool contract directly). The main question the verifier answers is whether the Merkle tree has been updated correctly

Verifier contracts are build within the [Groth16](http://www.zeroknowledgeblog.com/index.php/groth16) proving system. The Solidity source code is generating by a [fixed template](https://github.com/zeropoolnetwork/libzeropool/blob/master/res/verifier\_groth16.sol.tpl). To build the verifier you should provide verification keys which are generated during the [Ceremony](../zkbob-solution-deployment/trusted-setup-ceremony.md) process
