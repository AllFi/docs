# Anonymity Set Awareness

{% hint style="info" %}
To maintain privacy it is advisable to keep funds in the anonymity set for some time and consider transferring/withdrawing different arbitrary amounts than deposited when performing transactions. These measures allow for additional pool entropy and make it more difficult to infer any transaction details.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Although internal transaction details are hidden, users can be compromised when entering in or leaving the solution **in cases when there is a small anonymity set.**

Imagine you want to send money to Alice through zkBob. You decide to create a new account and deposit the exact necessary amount of tokens.&#x20;

Alice also creates an account and provides her private address. You transfer funds to Alice and she makes a withdrawal transaction for all received tokens.&#x20;

If you and Alice are the only active users of the zkBob solution, any neutral observer can infer your funds movement with a high degree of accuracy.

**There are no time limits for funds withdrawal.** It is recommended to keep funds inside the solution some extra time (the more the better) to increase the anonymity set and provide safeguards for your privacy.
