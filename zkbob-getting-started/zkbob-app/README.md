Users can perform the following operations when interacting with the application UI.

* [Create an Account](account-creation/) / Connect to an existing account
* [Make a Deposit](deposits.md)
* [Transfer within a Pool](transfers.md)
* [Withdraw Funds](withdrawals.md)

The zkBob application uses the [Zero Pool](https://zeropool.network/) library to prepare transactions and interact with the relayer. The application is responsible for:

* Processing transactions
* Restoring local state
* Building zkproofs from user input (ie amount, address)
* Interacting with the relayer
