# Account Creation

There are 2 ways to create a zkBob shielded account.&#x20;

1. ****[**Use a seed phrase**](./#seed-phrase). The application derives a seed phrase for you to store securely. You will use this seed phrase to restore your account as needed.
2. **Use a web3 wallet (MetMask/WalletConnect)**. The application collects a signature on your local browser and uses the private key from your web3 wallet to derive a zkBob account address.

## Seed Phrase

1\) Press the **Set up Account** button on the home screen.

Next, connect your 0x wallet on Gnosis Chain to deposit funds to your zkAccount.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using the same computer/browser for future zkBob sessions, you can access your account using only your password (assuming local storage has not been cleared). If you change browsers/computers or clear local storage, you will re-enter your seed phrase and create a new password to restore the account.
