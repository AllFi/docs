# Account Creation

There are 2 ways to create a zkBob shielded account.&#x20;

1. ****[**Use a seed phrase**](./#seed-phrase). The application derives a seed phrase for you to store securely. You will use this seed phrase to restore your account as needed.
2. **Use a web3 wallet (MetMask/WalletConnect)**. The application collects a signature and uses the private key from your web3 wallet to derive a zkBob account address.
