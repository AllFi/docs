# BOB Stable Token

To use zkBob, you need BOB!&#x20;

BOB is a stable token designed to function specifically with the zkBob privacy pool. BOB can be swapped for USDC using Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain, then [deposited ](zkbob-app/deposits.md)to the zkBob application through the UI.

On deposit, BOB are converted to shBOB, a shielded version of the token which can be transacted privately within the application. On withdrawal, shBOB are converted back to BOB, and BOB can be swapped back to USDC through the Uniswap interface.

Using Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain, users can swap USDC on GC to BOB. As with other ERC-20 based tokens, BOB can also be sent between chain users to any 0x address.&#x20;

shBOB can only be transferred within the zkBOB protocol, and should not be sent to an 0x address.\

<summary>How do BOB tokens remain stable?</summary>

BOB tokens are pre-minted and paired with an existing stable token (USDC) on Uniswap V3. Uniswap v3 features the ability to set a range for the exchange rate and provide concentrated liquidity for the pair, resulting  in limited slippage to the USDC peg.
