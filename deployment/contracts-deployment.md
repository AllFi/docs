# Contract Deployment

### Instructions for zkBob Contract Deployment

Contract deployment is managed through [Foundry solidity scripts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting).  Deployment can be simulated locally prior to production deployment, and contracts can be automatically verified on deployment to a public chain.&#x20;
