## How long should I keep my funds in the anonymity pool to ensure privacy?

It depends on how large the set is and how much activity has happened since your deposit. Looking at the number of deposits since your deposit can provide a rough estimation of safety (though not complete because it does not account for transfers within the protocol). In general, the longer you wait, the better.

## Is the code open-source?

The underlying code is open-source and anyone can deploy contracts, a relayer, and a cli to perform basic operations. The UI is not currently open-source to avoid simple clones. Code is available at [https://github.com/zkbob](https://github.com/zkbob)
