# zk Privacy Solution Comparison

## How does zkBob compare to Tornado.cash and zk.money?

zkBob has a similar architecture to Tornado.cash with some very important distinctions related to compliance. By introducing limits and geo restrictions, zkBob encourages honest users who want to discreetly transfer small fund amounts, and deters bad actors hoping to obscure or clean large amounts of ill-gotten funds.

zk.money does have some limits and may introduce more in the wake of the Tornado.cash crackdown. Primary differences between zkBob and zk.money relate to the rollup infrastructure and zkSNARK methodology. Note that zkBob is [exploring PLONK for v2](../../roadmap/on-the-roadmap.md), which will reduce computation size and improve the user experience.

Another important differentiator is zkBob’s use of the [BOB stable token](../../bob-stablecoin/bob-highlights.md) for transactions and fees. Tx fees do not fluctuate for users (hard coded to $0.10 per tx). If the actual tx cost is less, the extra amount is collected and dedicated to protocol and user support. The BOB token has additional utility including the ability to introduce [compounding](../../roadmap/exploratory-features/compounding.md) and lost/expired token redistribution. These features will provide future incentives for zkBob users through a [novel auction process ](../../roadmap/exploratory-features/xp/xp-based-auctions.md)and other TBD mechanisms.

Items on the [zkBob roadmap](broken-reference) including multi-chain deployment, decentralized relayer infrastructure, and fast client state sync also set it apart from competitors in the space.
