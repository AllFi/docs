# Use Case Examples

Below are 2 use case examples where zkBob helps different types of users achieve financial privacy.

## Carl :man\_office\_worker: the Small Business Employer

Carl has 5 employees he pays monthly with crypto. Carl‚Äôs preference is to keep salaries private while still processing them on-chain and using a stable asset for payment. zkBob makes it easy.

1. Carl and his employees each create their own zkBob zkAccounts, using either a seed phrase or wallet private key.
2. Carl swaps his monthly amount of payment in USDC for BOB stable tokens on Uniswap v3 on Polygon.
3. Carl deposits the BOB he receives into the zkBob application.
4. Each employee sends Carl their zkAddress in a private DM on Slack.
5. Carl transfers BOB to each employee for their monthly salary.
6. Once it is received (or at a later time to improve anonymity) employees can withdraw any amount of BOB into a 0x wallet on Polygon, convert their BOB back to USDC, and use however they wish. &#x20;
7. The history tab within each account makes it easy for employees to track and report their own transfers and withdrawals.
8. The process is repeated monthly, with employees DM‚Äôing Carl a newly generated zkAddress at the beginning of each month.&#x20;

## **Alice** üêá the Comic Book Collector&#x20;

Alice is a well-known comic book collector. She does a lot of business on the blockchain, but prefers to keep the details of her purchases, sales, customers and clients private. Luckily, she finds zkBob!

1. Alice uses 100 USDC to purchase 100 BOB stable tokens on Uniswap v3 on Polygon.&#x20;
2. She creates a zkBob account using the private key from an existing Ethereum Externally Owned Account (EOA). She could also create directly from a seed phrase, but chooses to create using MetaMask ü¶ä.
3. Once the account is connected, Alice deposits her 100 BOB into the zkBob pool.
4. Alice wants to buy an original Marvel comic from Carl.  She messages him privately and he sends her a private address he has generated in the zkBob app. Alice transfers 50 BOB to Carl within the pool. He mails the comics.
5. She is also owed some funds from Dave for a Ghost Rider. She sends him a generated address and receives 120 BOB. These transfers are catalogued in the UI and linked to her zkBob address, but not directly to her EOA.
6. Alice is ready to withdraw, but waits a few days to allow the anonymity set to grow. After a few days she orders a withdrawal to a newly generated EOA.&#x20;
7. Alice now has a new account with 170 BOB. She converts them back to 170 USDC on Uniswap. There is no way to determine the origin of the funds, and Alice, Carl and Dave are able to preserve their anonymity and grow their comic collections safely and securely, thanks to zkBob!
