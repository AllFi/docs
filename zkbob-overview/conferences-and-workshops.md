# Conferences & Workshops

The zkBob decentralized team is spreading the word about personal privacy options, compliance features, and zk tech through participation and sponsorship at many blockchain conferences and hackathons. We are partnering with [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) to sponsor several hackathons in 2023, and also participating at other conferences when we can.

Below are some highlights from events we've attended. See the [zkBob blog](https://blog.zkbob.com) for more in-depth overviews from these conferences.
