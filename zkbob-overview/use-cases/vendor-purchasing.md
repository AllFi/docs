# Vendor Purchasing

To retain a competitive advantage, businesses often need to keep the details of their purchases confidential. This includes information about the vendors they use and the prices they pay for wholesale goods. With zkBob, these details can be kept private, while transactions can still be referenced as needed for record keeping purposes.

## Generic Use Case

### **Alice** üêá the Comic Book Collector&#x20;

Alice runs a small business buying and selling comic books. She does a lot of business on the blockchain, but prefers to keep the details of her purchases, sales, customers and clients private. Luckily, she finds zkBob!

1. Alice uses 100 USDC to purchase 100 BOB stable tokens on Uniswap v3 on Polygon.&#x20;
2. She creates a zkBob account using the private key from an existing Ethereum Externally Owned Account (EOA). She could also create directly from a seed phrase, but chooses to create using MetaMask ü¶ä.
3. Once the account is connected, Alice deposits her 100 BOB into the zkBob pool.
4. Alice wants to buy an original Marvel comic from Carl.  She messages him privately and he sends her a private address he has generated in the zkBob app. Alice transfers 50 BOB to Carl within the pool. He mails the comics.
5. She is also owed some funds from Dave for a Ghost Rider. She sends him a generated address and receives 120 BOB. These transfers are catalogued in the UI and linked to her zkBob address, but not directly to her EOA.
6. Alice is ready to withdraw, but waits a few days to allow the anonymity set to grow. After a few days she orders a withdrawal to a newly generated EOA.&#x20;
7. Alice now has a new account with 170 BOB. She converts them back to 170 USDC on Uniswap. There is no way to determine the origin of the funds, and Alice, Carl and Dave are able to preserve their anonymity and grow their comic collections safely and securely, thanks to zkBob!
