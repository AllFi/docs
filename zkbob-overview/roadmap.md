# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
In process. Date estimates and additional items will be added as implementation details are clarified.
{% endhint %}

## V1

* :white\_check\_mark: Testing application (CLI and UI) deployed to Kovan
* :white\_check\_mark: Parallel transaction processing through relayers
* :white\_check\_mark: UI improvements (ongoing)
* Automated retry for failed txs.
* Eliminate password requirement for MetaMask zkaccount generation and usage.
* Bob Token creation with Uniswap v3 instance.
* MVP zkBob production application for private deposits, transfers, and withdrawals on a single TBD chain of record.&#x20;

## V1.5

* Bridge application for private bridged transactions deposits from Ethereum to a second EVM chain and withdrawals from the secondary EVM chain to Ethereum.

## V2+

* Optimism deployment to enable private and secure multi-chain functionality. A single zkpool will reside on a chain of record with withdrawals/deposits flowing through this pool. Transactions can be initiated from the originating chain, flow to the zkpool on the chain of record, then withdrawn to a destination chain of choice.
* Multi-relayers to improve speed and storage capabilities. Mechanisms are in development for determining relayer order and responsibilities to prevent any possible conflicts.&#x20;
* XP token exploration. The energy token may be leverage in future iterations to reward users or for additional tbd purposes.
* In-app private messaging so users can send generated zk addresses to other users without relying on third-party messaging.
