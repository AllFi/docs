# zkBob Usage

Up to date deposit and withdrawal statistics can be monitored via a Dune Analytics dashboard located at [https://dune.com/maxaleks/zkbob](https://dune.com/maxaleks/zkbob). Stats provide a big picture view of zkBob usage but cannot, by nature of the zk mechanisms in place, contain any transfer information (senders, receivers, amounts transferred).&#x20;

Tracked statistics include:

* Current Pool Size
* Deposits: Total amount deposited, number of deposits, number of unique depositors
* Withdrawals: Total amount withdrawn, number of withdrawals, number of unique withdrawers
* Daily Usage (deposits and withdrawals)
