# Deposits

{% hint style="warning" %}
All actions are performed on a test application running on Kovan testnet and using test Dai rather than Bob tokens. Instructions will be updated when app is live in production.
{% endhint %}

Deposits to the zkBob pool involve moving assets from a web3 wallet address into a zkAccount. You can use the UI to easily connect a wallet and deposit into a zkAccount.

1\) Check your [accounts are connected](account-creation/).

1. Web3 wallet address
2. zkAccount

_If you have previously setup your zkBob account with the private key method from a wallet, but the accounts are not instantly connected,_ [_follow the prompts_](account-creation/#web-3-wallet-connected) _to reconnect your account._

2\) You should have some amount of tokens available to deposit and a small amount of the native token (ie Kovan ETH) for gas. Select the amount and press **Deposit**.

3\) Approve the contract to access the token and make a deposit in MetaMask.

4\) Wait for several prompts as access is approved and a proof is generated. Next, sign the message and wait for the relayer to complete the deposit.
