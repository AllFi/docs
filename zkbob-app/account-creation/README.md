# Account Creation

There are 2 ways to create a zkBob shielded account.&#x20;

1. [**MetMask/WalletConnect**](./#metamask-walletconnect). The application collects a signature locally on your browser - not on the blockchain. It uses the private key from your web3 wallet to derive a secure zkBob account address.
2. [**Use a secret recovery phrase**](./#seed-phrase). The application generates a secret recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase) for you to store securely. You can use this seed phrase to restore your account and/or password as needed from any computer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Initial account creation can take several minutes depending on transaction volume in the pool. Please be patient while your account is created!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you've created your account, you can [generate a receiving address](../generate-a-secure-address.md) to receive a transfer, or [make a deposit](../deposits.md) if you have BOB.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Access Account Screen

If this is the first time you have accessed the app, you will be auto-directed to the create zkAccount screen after [acknowledging the terms](../acknowledge-terms.md). Otherwise, press **Get Started** or the **zkAccount button** at the top to reach the  zkAccount creation screen.

## MetaMask/WalletConnect

6\) Create and Re-enter password. This password is used to access the application, and can be regenerated using your wallet if needed.

6\) You will see the **Loading zkAccount** message while your account is created. Initial account creation can take several minutes depending on transaction volume in the pool. \
\
Once the account is created, you should now have 2 connected accounts, your web 3 wallet address ðŸ¦Š and your zkAccount, which is **auto-named beginning with zk.**

## Secret Recovery Phrase

{% hint style="info" %}
Also known as a seed phrase, you can create a new secret recovery phrase for your zkBob account. Be sure to store it securely off-line. If lost, there is no way to recover your account.
{% endhint %}

1\) Select **secret recovery phrase** in the popup box.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/recovery-phrase.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2\) View and write down your phrase somewhere safe (offline). It is not wise to use the copy feature or keep your seed phrase on the computer.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/seed-2.png)

3\) Re-enter your phrase by clicking on the words in order. Click **Verify** when you are done.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/confirm-seed.png)

4\) Create and confirm a password to use for accessing your account. You will enter this password each time the page refreshes and to access your account. You can create a new password if needed using your seed phrase.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zkbob-password.png)

5\) You will see the **Loading zkAccount** message while your account is created. Initial account creation can take several minutes depending on transaction volume in the pool. Once created, you will see your new account name. **This name is auto-generated, beginning with zk**. You can use this account to receive transfers and withdraw to a different `0x` address without ever connecting a web3 wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to [deposit funds](../deposits.md) to your zkAccount, [connect your 0x wallet](./#web3-wallet).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to receive a transfer, [generate a receiving address](../generate-a-secure-address.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using the same computer/browser for future zkBob sessions, you can access your account with only your password (assuming local storage has not been cleared). \
\
If you change browsers/computers or clear local storage, re-enter your seed phrase and create a new password to restore the account.
{% endhint %}

* [Make a Deposit](../deposits.md)
