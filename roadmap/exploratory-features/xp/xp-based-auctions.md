# XP-based Auctions

{% hint style="info" %}
Feature in research and development and will not be active for the first iteration of the zkBob application.
{% endhint %}

zkBob will earn some revenue for the protocol through funds compounding and fees. XP points may be used in an auction format to determine best usage for these funds.

These mechanics are still in the ideation phase, and more details will be available in the future.
